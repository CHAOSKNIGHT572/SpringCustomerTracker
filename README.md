This is a personal project applying Spring MVC and Hibernate framework.
It is a Customer Tracking System. Each Customer has a first name, last name and a email address.
User can list, add, delete, search, update(CRUD) customer information.

An intermediate level object called "Customer Service" is designed to delegate the CRUD calls to DAO, and eventually the mySQL database.
